Project Name
RPG creater

Description and Motivation:

This project will take my Java project and allow the user to sign in and save their worlds. Along some images to display what the objects look like.

Prior Art:

https://www.worldanvil.com/

Core User Workflow:

When you open the page you will be asked to sign up or login. Afterward if the user has worlds it will give a list of them with "Create world" appearing at the bottom. if none are created only the create button will be there. If they want to edit or delete they will click on the "Name" or "Title" of the world.


Daily Goals:
Tuesday: Get a basic landing page

Wednesday: Get basic interaction to create

Thursday: Get more complex interaction to create

Friday: Not Sure
