Core User Workflow:
When you open the page you will be asked to sign up or login. Afterward if the user has worlds it will give a list of them with "Create world" appearing at the bottom. if none are created only the create button will be there. If they want to edit or delete they will click on the "Name" or "Title" of the world.
